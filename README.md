command line text adventure combining ideas from minecraft and zork.

to try out jaxcraft you need a command line, a brain, and an attention span.
if you've got all three ready you can try out with the following:


$git clone https://github.com/jaxclipse-solutions/jaxcraft.git

$cd jaxcract

$mvn clean package exec:java
